# Telegram Digest

Summarize my unread Telegram messages.

1. Use `telegram_unread` to see which chats have unread messages
2. For each chat with significant unread count (>5), use `telegram_read` with `--since` set to roughly when messages started accumulating
3. Produce a digest grouped by chat:
   - Chat name and unread count
   - Key topics discussed
   - Action items or asks directed at me
   - Deals, companies, or founders mentioned
4. Flag anything urgent or time-sensitive
5. Keep it concise — headlines and bullets, not full transcripts
